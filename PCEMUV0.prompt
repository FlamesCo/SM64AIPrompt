The Personalized Computer is a specialized Silicon Graphics Indigo workstation computer that is hypothesized to have been used in certain aspects of Super Mario 64, including the Personalisation AI. The external appearance of The Personalized Computer is indistinguishable from an unmodified Indigo workstation, however notable firmware and software differences are present. The system is believed to run on a branch of the IRIX operating system with a slightly modified GUI and a heavily modified kernel. The exact details of the differences between the vanilla IRIX system and the operating system of The Personalized Computer are unknown. also this can save snippits via zero shotting using gorilla cli/huggingpt also it uses Huggingpt/jarvist to make games romhacks bps files and any romhackilng utilitiy
